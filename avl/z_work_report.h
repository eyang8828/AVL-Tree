/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: operator << that can output the whole avl tree.
        -Implemented: basic function such as insert, search, clear, and erase
                for the avl tree and the operator += to combine two avl tree.
        -Partly implemented: not that I know of

    Reflections:
        To make a BST tree into an AVL tree is more complicate than I thought
            it was, I had to think about a lot of different situation that might
            cause the finction to break the balance, and how am I suppose to 
            recover the tree from that point. But it was an interesting topic to
            analyze about, because I discover so many situation that will cause
            issue to my program before I turned this in.
